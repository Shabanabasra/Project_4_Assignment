#This can be done via something called hashing. Hashing is when we take something and convert it into a different, unique identifier. This is done using a hash function. Luckily, there are several resources that can help us with this.
#For example, using a hash function called SHA256(...) something as simple ashellocan be hashed into a much more complex2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824
#Fill out the login(...) function for a website that hashes their passwords. Login should return True if an email's stored password hash in stored_logins is the same as the hash of password_to_check.(Hint. You will need to use the provided hash_password(...) function. You don't necessarily need to know how it works, just know that hash_password(...) returns the hash for the password!)
